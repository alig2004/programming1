Explain the following C code segment:
int my_array[5] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
int *p;
int i = 0;

p = my_array;

for (i=0; i<5; i++)
{
	printf("%d\n", *(p+i));
}


Solution:
line 1: initalising a 5 element array
line 2: creating a pointer called p
line 3: initialising element i (index) to 0

line 5: pointing p at the array my_array

line 7: beginning a for loop, initialising i to 0, running it while i is less than 5 and adding 1 to i for each run
line 8: opening curly bracket of the loop
line 9: printing the contents of the array using the dereference operator 
line 10: closing curly bracket of the loop
