What is wrong with the following C code? Suggest a solution to correct the issue.

int* fxn()
{
    int num = 5;
    int *ptr;

    ptr = &num;
    return ptr;
}

------------------

Should be:
int* fxn()
{
    static int num = 5;
    int *ptr;

    ptr = &num;
    return ptr;
}

The data of variable num will be wiped upon exiting the function as it is a local variables, the address will therefore be meaningless as nothing is in the address
Setting num to a static variable will keep the variable in memory even once the function is exited
